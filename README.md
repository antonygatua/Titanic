# Titanic
When doing programming the first programm 90% of programmers write is printing hello world. For Data Science , Predict if a passenger in the titanic ship survived or died during the sinking
## Logistic Regression
Fast algorithm used to make the prediction .
The algorithm had an accuracy of 79.33% 
## Decision Tree Algorithm 
used the algorithm to improve the results of the prediction to 79.89% 
Did not fine tune the algorithm though . 
* Bagging and boosting can be used to improve the algorithm
## Random Forest algorithm 
Resulted in 82% accuarcy which is not good but can be used in this case

## Kaggle Results
as a test , i posted the results in Kaggle and I predicted correctlly the fate of 77 % of the passengers on the ship .
